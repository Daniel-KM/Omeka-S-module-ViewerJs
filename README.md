ViewerJs (module for Omeka S)
=============================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Viewer Js] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to display common document
formats (pdf, standard office ones), via a light viewer.

. Supported formats are:

- Portable document format (pdf)
- OpenDocument Text (odt, fodt)
- OpenDocument Spreadsheet (ods, fods)
- OpenDocument Presentation (odp, fodp)

Common multimedia formats can be managed too, if they are displayable by the
browser. They are not enabled by default, because they are natively managed by
Omeka S.

- Images (jpg, png, gif)
- Audio/video (via html5)

Concretely, it includes the [ViewerJS] library, that integrates the pdf library
of Mozilla [pdf.js] and the standard office formats via [WebODF]. The images and
the audio/video are displayed via the browser itself.

* Note about WebODF

For office documents, the bigger they are, the bigger should be the computer of
the visitor to display them.

Because the standards of the [Document Foundation] are "simple" and easy to
manage, the library [WebODF] is mainly a stylesheet. And because this is a true
standard, it is sustainable, stable and available to anyone. So it’s recommended
for any office work.


Installation
------------

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

This module requires the module [Common], that should be installed first.

The module uses an external library, [ViewerJS], so use the release zip to
install it, or use and init the source.

* From the zip

Download the last release [ViewerJs.zip] from the list of releases (the master
does not contain the dependency), and uncompress it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `ViewerJs`, and go to the root module, and run:

```sh
composer install --no-dev
```

Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.


Config
------

All resources of Omeka S that are in pdf, odt, fodt, ods, fods, odp, fodp, and
txt are automatically displayed by the ViewerJs, so you have nothing to do.

Sources files can use uploaded files or url, so you can try an url such: https://github.com/Daniel-KM/ViewerJS/raw/master/test/files/presentation.odp.

Options can be set differently for the admin board or each site. Only one option
is available directly: the styles of the iframe. Other ones are managed via the
rendered.

To display the media (images, audio, video) via the ViewerJS, copy and adapt the
section `['file_renderers']['aliases']` in `config/module.config.php` in your
`config/local.config.php`.

To display the pdf with the more complete viewer provided by the module [Pdf Viewer],
you need to set its value in your local config too:

```php
            'application/pdf' => 'pdfViewer',
            'pdf' => 'pdfViewer',
```


### Advanced display in public theme

Because the viewer is integrated as a renderer and not a helper, it is possible
to display it anywhere via the media. In particular, you can use the standard
block "Media" to display it in any page. So just render the media, with possible
options, that are passed directly to the template:

```php
echo $media->render($options);
```

A block layout is available too if needed for external urls. Furthermore, a view
helper is available to render any url anywhere:

```php
$options = ['source' => 'https://example.org/my-file.odp'];
echo $this->viewerJs(null, $options);
```

### Fix with module Dropbox

When Dropbox is used as a backend for files, you may need to hack the asset file
"asset/vendor/viewerjs/viewer.js", commenting lines 305 to 309:

```js
/*
        if ( documentUrl.indexOf('?') !== -1 ) {
            documentUrl += '&contentDispositionType=attachment';
        } else {
            documentUrl += '?contentDispositionType=attachment';
        }
*/
```


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
